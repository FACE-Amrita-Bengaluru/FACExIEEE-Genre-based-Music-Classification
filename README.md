# Genre-based-Music-Classification
A basic Machine Learning model with Jupyter framework which analyzes the given sample and recognizes its genre.

# Genre-Classification
A music genre is basically categorization of pieces of music.It is to be distinguished from musical form and musical style.

Music can be divided into genres in varying ways, such as into pop music, jazz music, metal music, hip hop music, blues music and so on. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective. So few genres may overlap.

# The motive of this project
This is an open-source project, in which we have gathered data and predict the genre of a given music sample. We are predicting the genre of a song based on certain parameters in prominent datasets found online.This simple ML Model can be developed further and can be applied into different music based softwares.
